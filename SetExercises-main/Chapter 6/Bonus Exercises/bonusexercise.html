<!--for this exercise, the task is to create any webpage so long as it's fully functioning-->

<!--
    the webpage i made was pretty derivative of what i did for the "temperature calculator" activity
    but besides that, it was also inspired from my high school days when i was having a hard time remembering formulas
-->
