        <!--
            in the body, i first added a <header> section (to define that part of the page);
            i added a class to a <div> inside the said section in order to modify the header text in css
        -->
        <header>
            <div class="title">Temperature Calculator</div>

        <!--
            i then added a <form>...
            
            i used this tag because out of all the tags i learned throughout the course, this seemed the most appropriate;
            with <form> i can submit the tag, which gives possibilities for pages with tasks like these
        -->
        <form class="box" id="myForm">
            <!--
                inside the form, there are different <div> classes...

                the first ones are the "from" and "to" classes, which both have <select>-<option> tags;
            -->
            <div class="from">
                From: 
                <!--
                    these <select>-<option> tags have a similarity to arrays...

                    the <select> allows you to have a dropdown selection option;
                    which work hand-in-hand with the <option> tag;
                    and gives the <select> tag multiple choices that contain different values
                -->
                <select id="select1">
                    <!--
                        i created 5 <option> tags for each <select>;
                        four of which are selectable choices, and one is not

                        i had the first one act like a placeholder, and i made it hidden via css;
                        th rest were given values from one through four to be used in js later on
                    -->
                    <option value="" class="placeholder" disabled selected>Select a scale type</option>
                    <option value="1">Celcius (°C)</option>
                    <option value="2">Farenheit (°F)</option>
                    <option value="3">Kelvin (°K)</option>
                    <option value="4">Rankine (R)</option>
                </select>

            <div class="to">

                    <option value="1">Celcius (°C)</option>
                    <option value="2">Farenheit (°F)</option>

            </div>

            <!--
                the next <div> class is for the user input...

                i used an <input> tag typed as number (because it's the most appropriate for the situation);
                it also has an id, which is used for js;
                and a placeholder, so it doesn't look empty while giving the user an idea of what to do
            -->
            <div class="converter">
                Enter value for conversion:
                <br>
                <input type="number" id="convertit" placeholder="Enter value here...">
            </div>
            
            <!--
                next, i added two <button> tags, with one being a submit type, and the other a button type

                the submit type button, helps me clear the page to reset back to default without refreshing (by calling a js function);
                and the button type button helps me give a custom command to it, which in this case, is to convert the user given temperatue (again, using a js function)

                as seen below, there is an attribute called "onclick,"
                which basically tells the computer to only call the function when the <button> is pressed by the user
            -->
            <button type="submit" value="Clear" class="clearb" onclick="clearForm()">Clear</button>
            <button type="button" value="Convert" class="convertb" onclick="convert()">Convert</button>

            <!--
                now, for the last two section of the <form>, i have <div> classes named "answer" and "solution,"
                which were made to display the answer and solution for the user

                inside each of the <div> classes, there is another <div> class that display the text in the center of the parent <div>;
                i used the "class" attribute to modify it via css and the "id" attribute to connet it to js
            -->
            <div class="answer">
                Answer:
                <br><br>
                <div class="answertext" id="displayans"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="solution">
                Solution:
                <br><br>
                <div class="solutiontext" id="displaysol"></div>
            </div>
        </form>

        <!--
            and right before i end the <body> tag, i added my <script> tag to connect this file to my js file
        -->
        <script src="tempcalc.js"></script>
    </body>
