                to create a hitmap, i imported an image (that i made) using an <img> tag;
                inside that tag, i added an attribute called "usemap" to define the image as a hitmap

                i then used the <map> tag and called the image through the "name=" attribute
                
                inside the <map> tag, i used <area> tags to define the areas of the image that the user can click;
                
                in this case, i used "rect" because the shapes i need were squares
                i inputted the coordinates using the "coords=" attribute for the program to know where the are is specifically
                and i added the link the user will be redirected to when pressing a certain are of the image with the "href=" attribute
            -->
