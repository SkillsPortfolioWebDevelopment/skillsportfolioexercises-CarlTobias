All of the exercises here were coded by me, Carl Amir P. Tobias.


I operated with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my editor and whenever I would open .html files for viewing,
I used Opera GX as my browser with the sidebar enabled.

That being said, some of the files may not look correct in other browsers (or screens for that matter).
I tried my best to figure out how to make my outputs adaptable to different devices and browsers, but as of now,
it is out of my skill level.

If you would like to see it as close to how I view it, you may download the Opera GX and open there.
I also added screenshots of the pages for reference.


Thank You.
