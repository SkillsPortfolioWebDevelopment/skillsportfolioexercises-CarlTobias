                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 81%

                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone adapts its source material faithfully while condensing the novel's overstuffed narrative 
                into an involving -- and often downright exciting -- big-screen magical caper.

                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 82%
                <strong>Audience Score:</strong> 80%
                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                Though perhaps more enchanting for younger audiences, Chamber of Secrets is nevertheless both darker and livelier than its 
                predecessor, expanding and improving upon the first film's universe.

                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 90%

                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                Under the assured direction of Alfonso Cuaron, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban triumphantly strikes a delicate balance 
                between technical wizardry and complex storytelling.

                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 88%
                <strong>Audience Score:</strong> 74%
                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                The main characters are maturing, and the filmmakers are likewise improving on their craft; vibrant special effects and assured 
                performances add up to what is the most complex yet of the Harry Potter films.

                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 78%
                <strong>Audience Score:</strong> 81%
                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                It's not easy to take the longest Harry Potter book and streamline it into the shortest HP movie, but director David Yates does a 
                bang up job of it, creating an Order of the Phoenix that's entertaining and action-packed.

                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 84%
                <strong>Audience Score:</strong> 78%
                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                Dark, thrilling, and occasionally quite funny, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is also visually stunning and emotionally 
                satisfying.
                <br><br>


                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 77%

                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                It can't help but feel like the prelude it is, but Deathly Hallows: Part I is a beautifully filmed, emotionally satisfying 
                penultimate installment for the Harry Potter series.

                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 96%
                <strong>Audience Score:</strong> 89%
                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                Thrilling, powerfully acted, and visually dazzling, Deathly Hallows Part II brings the Harry Potter franchise to a 
                satisfying -- and suitably magical -- conclusion.
