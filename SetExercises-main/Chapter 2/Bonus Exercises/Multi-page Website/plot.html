                When mysterious letters start arriving on his doorstep, Harry Potter has never heard of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
                <br><br>

                They are swiftly confiscated by his aunt and uncle.
                <br><br>

                Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a strange man bursts in with some important news: Harry Potter is a wizard and has been awarded a place to study at Hogwarts.
                <br><br>

                And so the first of the Harry Potter adventures is set to begin.
                <br><br>
            </ul>

            <ul id="BookTwo">
                <div class="titles">Book Two: The Chamber of Secrets</div>

                Throughout the summer holidays after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter has been 
                receiving sinister warnings from a house-elf called Dobby.
                <br><br>

                Now, back at school to start his second year, Harry hears unintelligible whispers echoing through the corridors.
                <br><br>

                Before long the attacks begin: students are found as if turned to stone.
                <br><br>

                Dobby's predictions seem to be coming true.
                <br><br>
            </ul>

            <ul id="BookThree">
                <div class="titles">Book Three: The Prisoner of Azkaban</div>

                For Harry Potter, it's the start of another far-from-ordinary year at Hogwarts when the Knight Bus crashes through the 
                darkness and comes to an abrupt halt in front of him.
                <br><br>

                It turns out that Sirius Black, mass-murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort, has escaped - and they say he is coming 
                after Harry.
                <br><br>

                In his first Divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry's tea leaves.
                <br><br>

                And perhaps most frightening of all are the Dementors patrolling the school grounds with their soul-sucking kiss - in 
                search of fresh victims.
                <br><br>
            </ul>

            <ul id="BookFour">
                <div class="titles">Book Four: The Goblet of Fire</div>

                The rules of the Triwizard Tournament, which is about to take place at Hogwarts, only allow wizards over the age of seventeen 
                to enter.
                <br><br>

                So Harry can only daydream about winning.
                <br><br>

                Then, to his surprise, on Halloween when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, his name is picked out of the magical cup.
                <br><br>

                Harry will face life-endangering tasks, dragons and Dark wizards.
                <br><br>

                He'll have to rely on the help of his friends if he is to make it through the contest alive.
                <br><br>
            </ul>

            <ul id="BookFive">
                <div id="titles">Book Five: The Order of the Phoenix</div>

                After the Dementors' attack on his cousin Dudley, Harry knows he is about to become Voldemort's next target.
                <br><br>

                Although many are denying the Dark Lord's return, Harry is not alone, and a secret order is gathering at Grimmauld Place to 
                fight against the Dark forces.
                <br><br>

                Meanwhile, Voldemort's savage assaults on Harry's mind are growing stronger every day.
                <br><br>

                He must allow Professor Snape to teach him to protect himself before he runs out of time.
                <br><br>
            </ul>

            <ul id="BookSix">
                <div id="titles">Book Six: The Half-Blood Prince</div>

                One summer night, when Dumbledore arrives at Privet Drive to collect Harry Potter, his wand hand is blackened and shrivelled, 
                but he will not reveal why.
                <br><br>

                Rumours and suspicion spread through the wizarding world - it feels as if even Hogwarts itself might be under threat.
                <br><br>

                Harry is convinced that Malfoy bears the Dark Mark: could there be a Death Eater amongst them?
                <br><br>

                He will need powerful magic and true friends as, with the help of Dumbledore, he investigates Voldemort's darkest secrets.
                <br><br>
            </ul>

            <ul id="BookSeven">
                <div id="titles">Book Seven: The Deathly Hallows</div>

                Harry Potter is leaving Privet Drive for the last time. But as he climbs into the sidecar of Hagrid's motorbike and they take 
                to the skies, he knows Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters will not be far behind.
                <br><br>

                The protective charm that has kept him safe until now is broken. But the Dark Lord is breathing fear into everything he loves. 
                And he knows he can't keep hiding.
                <br><br>

                To stop Voldemort, Harry knows he must find the remaining Horcruxes and destroy them.
                <br><br>

                He will have to face his enemy in one final battle.
