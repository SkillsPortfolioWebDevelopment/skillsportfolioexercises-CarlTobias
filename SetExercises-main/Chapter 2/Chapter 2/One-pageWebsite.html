<!--
    Pick a television series, film or game and design a really simple one-page website (just text, no images). Your website should include:
        - An overview of the plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find.
        - A nav bar at the top which allows the user to quickly navigate to sections further down the page (anchor Ids).
        - A link to the actual website of the film/game etc. which opens in a new tab when clicked.
        - Use of an external CSS file to style elements creatively (avoid inline styling and use classes instead).
        - At least two classes.
        - One link styled as a button.

                    The first book introduces readers to Harry Potter, an 11 year old boy that lives in the world of non-magical beings, 
                    or Muggles as they are called. On his 11th birthday he is visited by the half-giant Rubeus Hagrid and is introduced to the 
                    wizarding world and enrolled him in the Hogwarts School for Witches and Wizards. Hogwarts is where Harry meets his two best 
                    friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and the great wizard and headmaster of the school, Albus Dumbledore. The story 
                    revolves around Harry during his studies at Hogwarts, Harry learns of the reasons why he has magical powers, who his parents 
                    are and how they died, and his connection with the man who killed them, the evil wizard Lord Voldemort.
                    <br><br>

                    In his early years at Hogwarts, Harry learns of how Lord Voldemort killed Harry's parents and even tried to kill Harry as well. 
                    But mysteriously Voldemort was defeated and believed to have died while Harry survived having only the scar on his forehead as 
                    proof of their encounter. In the first four books Voldemort, who is not dead but merely in hiding and trying to regain his lost 
                    powers, have tried to kill Harry using different methods from the shadows, but thanks to the help of his friends Ron and Hermione,
                    Harry and the forces of good always triumphs in the end.
                    <br><br>

                    In the end of the fourth book, Lord Voldemort has regained his old body and his full powers as well. At this time he openly 
                    declares war on Hogwarts and the entire wizarding world. At this time the story revolving around Harry has become less of a 
                    mystery and changed onto something that is more of a conflict between two warring factions. At this point Albus Dumbledore 
                    decides that he can no longer protect Harry from Voldemort, so he decides to train Harry personally on the ways of magic.
                    <br><br>

                    While under Dumbledore's tutelage, Harry becomes a more powerful wizard that is able to protect himself and others. He gets to 
                    show what he has learned from Dumbledore when Voldemort's army, mostly composed of escaped convicts from Azkaban 
                    (the high-security prison for evil wizards), attacked Harry and his friends.
                    <br><br>

                    In the sixth book of the series "The Half-blood Prince," Dumbledore tells Harry of the only way that Voldemort can be defeated. 
                    Voldemort has divided his soul and placed them in various objects called Horcruxes and hid them all over the wizarding world, 
                    to defeat Voldemort they need to destroy all of the Horcruxes.
                    <br><br>

                    Dumbledore and Harry thus set out on a mission to destroy the containers of Lord Voldemort's soul, but an unexpected traitorous 
                    act tragically ends the life of Albus Dumbledore, leaving Harry wondering just how they can expect to defeat the evil of Voldemort
                    now. In the last book "The Deathly Hollows," Harry finds out that he himself is a Horcrux. This forces him to make a decision 
                    that could either destroy or save the wizarding world.
                    <br><br>

                    This is just a brief summary on how the events in the world of Harry Potter unfolded. If you want to have a deeper understanding 
                    of the world of Harry Potter, try and read the books and prepare to dive into a fantastical and magical world.

                    When mysterious letters start arriving on his doorstep, Harry Potter has never heard of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
                    <br><br>

                    They are swiftly confiscated by his aunt and uncle.
                    <br><br>

                    Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a strange man bursts in with some important news: Harry Potter is a wizard and has been awarded a place to study at Hogwarts.
                    <br><br>

                    And so the first of the Harry Potter adventures is set to begin.
                    <br><br>


                    <div id="titles">Book Two: The Chamber of Secrets</div>

                    Throughout the summer holidays after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter has been 
                    receiving sinister warnings from a house-elf called Dobby.
                    <br><br>

                    Now, back at school to start his second year, Harry hears unintelligible whispers echoing through the corridors.
                    <br><br>

                    Before long the attacks begin: students are found as if turned to stone.
                    <br><br>

                    Dobby's predictions seem to be coming true.
                    <br><br>


                    <div id="titles">Book Three: The Prisoner of Azkaban</div>

                    For Harry Potter, it's the start of another far-from-ordinary year at Hogwarts when the Knight Bus crashes through the 
                    darkness and comes to an abrupt halt in front of him.
                    <br><br>

                    It turns out that Sirius Black, mass-murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort, has escaped - and they say he is coming 
                    after Harry.
                    <br><br>

                    In his first Divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry's tea leaves.
                    <br><br>

                    And perhaps most frightening of all are the Dementors patrolling the school grounds with their soul-sucking kiss - in 
                    search of fresh victims.
                    <br><br>


                    <div id="titles">Book Four: The Goblet of Fire</div>

                    The rules of the Triwizard Tournament, which is about to take place at Hogwarts, only allow wizards over the age of seventeen 
                    to enter.
                    <br><br>

                    So Harry can only daydream about winning.
                    <br><br>

                    Then, to his surprise, on Halloween when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, his name is picked out of the magical cup.
                    <br><br>

                    Harry will face life-endangering tasks, dragons and Dark wizards.
                    <br><br>

                    He'll have to rely on the help of his friends if he is to make it through the contest alive.
                    <br><br>


                    <div id="titles">Book Five: The Order of the Phoenix</div>

                    After the Dementors' attack on his cousin Dudley, Harry knows he is about to become Voldemort's next target.
                    <br><br>

                    Although many are denying the Dark Lord's return, Harry is not alone, and a secret order is gathering at Grimmauld Place to 
                    fight against the Dark forces.
                    <br><br>

                    Meanwhile, Voldemort's savage assaults on Harry's mind are growing stronger every day.
                    <br><br>

                    He must allow Professor Snape to teach him to protect himself before he runs out of time.
                    <br><br>


                    <div id="titles">Book Six: The Half-Blood Prince</div>

                    One summer night, when Dumbledore arrives at Privet Drive to collect Harry Potter, his wand hand is blackened and shrivelled, 
                    but he will not reveal why.
                    <br><br>

                    Rumours and suspicion spread through the wizarding world - it feels as if even Hogwarts itself might be under threat.
                    <br><br>

                    Harry is convinced that Malfoy bears the Dark Mark: could there be a Death Eater amongst them?
                    <br><br>

                    He will need powerful magic and true friends as, with the help of Dumbledore, he investigates Voldemort's darkest secrets.
                    <br><br>


                    <div id="titles">Book Seven: The Deathly Hallows</div>

                    Harry Potter is leaving Privet Drive for the last time. But as he climbs into the sidecar of Hagrid's motorbike and they take 
                    to the skies, he knows Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters will not be far behind.
                    <br><br>

                    The protective charm that has kept him safe until now is broken. But the Dark Lord is breathing fear into everything he loves. 
                    And he knows he can't keep hiding.
                    <br><br>

                    To stop Voldemort, Harry knows he must find the remaining Horcruxes and destroy them.
                    <br><br>

                    He will have to face his enemy in one final battle.

                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 81%

                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone adapts its source material faithfully while condensing the novel's overstuffed narrative 
                into an involving -- and often downright exciting -- big-screen magical caper.

                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 82%
                <strong>Audience Score:</strong> 80%
                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                Though perhaps more enchanting for younger audiences, Chamber of Secrets is nevertheless both darker and livelier than its 
                predecessor, expanding and improving upon the first film's universe.

                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 90%
                <strong>Audience Score:</strong> 86%
                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                Under the assured direction of Alfonso Cuaron, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban triumphantly strikes a delicate balance 
                between technical wizardry and complex storytelling.

                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 88%
                <strong>Audience Score:</strong> 74%
                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                The main characters are maturing, and the filmmakers are likewise improving on their craft; vibrant special effects and assured 
                performances add up to what is the most complex yet of the Harry Potter films.

                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 78%
                <strong>Audience Score:</strong> 81%
                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                It's not easy to take the longest Harry Potter book and streamline it into the shortest HP movie, but director David Yates does a 
                bang up job of it, creating an Order of the Phoenix that's entertaining and action-packed.

                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 84%
                <strong>Audience Score:</strong> 78%
                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                Dark, thrilling, and occasionally quite funny, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is also visually stunning and emotionally 
                satisfying.
                <br><br>


                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 77%
                <strong>Audience Score:</strong> 85%
                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                It can't help but feel like the prelude it is, but Deathly Hallows: Part I is a beautifully filmed, emotionally satisfying 
                penultimate installment for the Harry Potter series.

                <div id="titles">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</div>
                <strong>Tomatometer:</strong> 96%
                <strong>Audience Score:</strong> 89%
                <br><br>
                <strong>Critics Consensus:</strong><br>
                Thrilling, powerfully acted, and visually dazzling, Deathly Hallows Part II brings the Harry Potter franchise to a 
                satisfying -- and suitably magical -- conclusion.
