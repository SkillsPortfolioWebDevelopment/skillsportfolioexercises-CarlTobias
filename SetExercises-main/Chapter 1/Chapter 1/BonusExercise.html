        <h3>By Carl Tobias</h3>

        <!--
            inside the <h2> tag, i used a tag called "class"
            this allows us to make a variety of custom styles for the same tag (in this case <h2>)
            which means that the text inside this tag will be a little different from the same tags with different classes
            besides that, it's also used as a way to organize the code to make it more understandable

            and the margin command is used to position the border element to my liking
            (i added it here and not in the css because i didn't wat to mess up the positioning for the others)

        <!--
            the <pre> tag used here defines a preformatted text
            this allows the user to add as many white and tab spaces and the text will be printed as is, unlike with the paragraph (<p>) tag\
            so what you see here, will be what is printed on the page

            <strong>1. </strong>Someone's mom is currently using you as either a good or bad example for her kids.
            <strong>2. </strong>Birthday presents are your rewards for not dying that year.
            <strong>3. </strong>Why are prisoners given food and water, but the homeless aren't?
            <strong>4. </strong>There's no way to prove that we all see the same colours.
            <strong>5. </strong>The amount of people older than you never increases.
            <strong>6. </strong>Your belly button used to be your mouth.
            <strong>7. </strong>How does your tongue know how something will feel when you look at it?
            <strong>8. </strong>If you work at a farm and you take care of chickens, then that makes you a "chicken tneder."
            <strong>9. </strong>The skeleton isn't inside you, you're the brain, so you're the one inside the skeleton.
            <strong>10. </strong>My debit card pays for things with past hours of my life, while my credit card pays with the future hours of my life.
