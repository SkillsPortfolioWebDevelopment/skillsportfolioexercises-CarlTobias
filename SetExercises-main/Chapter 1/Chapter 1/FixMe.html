<!--the first thing i did was to fix the miscapitalization of doctype-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
    then added the <head> tag, because that is where other tags like <title> belong
    the <head> tag is basically a container where data about data (metadata) is stored
-->
<head>

    <title>FIXME!</title>
    <!--i used a external stylesheet to customize the page to the instructor's liking-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="fixme.css">

</head>

<!--
    next, i added the <body> tag to let the computer know what goes into the body of the html page
    i also arranged the heirarchy of the text, so it makes sense to the reader

<body>

    <h2>Chapter I. Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>

    <p>
        <br>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do:
        once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it,
        'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations?'<br>
        
        <!--i also removed the "p>" that was placed before the first word, and i used one main paragraph (<p>) tag for the story-->
        <br>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid),
        whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
        when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.<br>

        <br>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
        'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
        but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
        Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket,
        or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it,
        and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.<br>
