<!--
    in this exercise, we are tasked to perform a similar action to the wireframe activity,
    but this time we have to copy the whole page (with text)

    because it's essentially the same as the wireframe exercise,
    i used the same layout and code with slight differences in the stylesheet
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
    <head>
        <!--inside the head tag, i added the title of the page along with the link connecting its corresponding styleesheet-->
        <title>Digifest 2022</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="structure.css">
    </head>

    <body>
        <!--
            and inside the body tag, there are multiple tags used for separating secions

            there's <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>
        -->

        <header>
            <!--
                inside the header is the title text and the navigation bar

                i used this tag multiple times to indicate a new section,
                they have different sizes and that is why you will see different classes;
                to separate them and give them variety while still using the same tag

                there's another <header> tag, an <article> tag, an <aside> tag, and some <div> tags

                the <header> tags are under other classes to emphasize the header of that section without overpowering the other headers
                the <article> tags are under different classes named "paragraph" and "h3-3" to give attributes to the body text for those sections
                the <aside> tag indicates the blue section on the side of the page
                the <div> tags are made specifically to substitute the images
